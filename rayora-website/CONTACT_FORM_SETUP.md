# Contact Form Setup & Configuration

## 🚀 Current Status

Your contact form is now **working** and will:
- ✅ Validate all form fields
- ✅ Log all submissions to the server console
- ✅ Display success/error messages to users
- ✅ Send emails when properly configured

## 📧 Email Configuration (Optional but Recommended)

To receive email notifications of form submissions, follow these steps:

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended)
1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com) and create a free account
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   ```
4. Restart your development server

### Option 2: Other Email Services
You can also integrate with:
- **SendGrid**: Popular email service
- **Nodemailer**: Use any SMTP provider
- **Amazon SES**: AWS email service

## 🧪 Testing Your Contact Form

1. **Development Testing**:
   - Visit: http://localhost:3001/contact
   - Fill out the form and submit
   - Check your terminal/console for logs

2. **Production Testing**:
   - Deploy your site
   - Test the form on your live site
   - Check server logs or email inbox

## 📋 What Happens When Someone Submits

### Without Email Configuration:
- Form data is logged to console
- User sees success message
- You can check server logs to see submissions

### With Email Configuration:
- Form data is logged to console
- Email is sent to info@rayora.com
- User sees success message
- You receive email notification

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Form Not Working?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server terminal for error messages
3. Verify API route is accessible at `/api/contact`

### Not Receiving Emails?
1. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Check if using correct "from" domain
3. Check spam folder
4. Verify email address in API route

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Uses `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's test domain)
- **Production**: You may need to verify your own domain
